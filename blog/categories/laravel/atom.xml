    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Testing controllers isn't the easiest thing in the world. Well, let me rephrase that: testing them is a cinch; what's difficult, at least at first, is determining <em>what</em> to test.</p>

<p>Should a controller test verify text on the page? Should it touch the database? Should it ensure that variables exist in the view? If this is your first hay-ride, these things can be confusing! Let me help.</p>

<blockquote><p>Controller tests should verify responses, ensure that the correct database access methods are triggered, and the appropriate instance variables are sent to the view.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Hello World of Controller Testing</h2>

<p>The best way to learn these things is through examples. Here's the hello world of controller tests in Laravel.</p>

<p>```js app/tests/controllers/PostsControllerTest.php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>class PostsControllerTest extends TestCase {</p>

<pre><code>public function testIndex()
{
    $this-&gt;client-&gt;request('GET', 'posts');
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Laravel leverages a handful of Symfony's components to ease the process of testing routes and views, including HttpKernel, DomCrawler, and BrowserKit. This is why it's paramount that your PHPUnit tests inherit from, not <code>PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase</code>, but <code>TestCase</code>. Don't worry, Laravel still extends the former, but it helps setup the Laravel app for testing, as well as provides a variety of helper assertion methods that you are encouraged to use. More on that shortly.</p>

<p>In the code snippet above, we make a <code>GET</code> request to <code>/posts</code>, or <code>localhost:8000/posts</code>. Assuming that this line is added to a fresh installation of Laravel, Symfony will throw a <code>NotFoundHttpException</code>. If working along, try it out by running <code>phpunit</code> from the command line.</p>

<pre><code>$ phpunit
1) PostsControllerTest::testIndex
Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\NotFoundHttpException:
</code></pre>

<p>In <em>human-speak</em>, this essentially translates to, "<em>Hey, I tried to call that route, but you don't have anything registered, fool!</em>"</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this type of request is common enough to the point that it makes sense to provide a helper method, such as <code>$this-&gt;call()</code>. In fact, Laravel does that very thing! This means that the previous example can be refactored, like so:</p>

<p>```js app/tests/PostsControllerTest.php
public function testIndex()
{</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;call('GET', 'posts');
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<h3>Overloading is Your Friend</h3>

<p>Though we'll stick with the base functionality in this chapter, in my personal projects, I take things a step further by allowing for such methods as <code>$this-&gt;get()</code>, <code>$this-&gt;post()</code>, etc. Thanks to PHP overloading, this only requires the addition of a single method, which you could add to <code>app/tests/TestCase.php</code>.</p>

<p>```js app/tests/controllers/PostsControllerTest.php
public function __call($method, $args)
{</p>

<pre><code>if (in_array($method, ['get', 'post', 'put', 'patch', 'delete']))
{
    $this-&gt;call($method, $args[0]);
}

throw new BadMethodCallException;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Now, you're free to write <code>$this-&gt;get('posts')</code> and achieve the exact same result as the previous two examples. As noted above, however, let's stick with the framework's base offerings for simplicity's sake.</p>

<p>To make the test pass, we only need to prepare the proper route.</p>

<p>```js app/routes.php
&lt;?php</p>

<pre><code>Route::get('posts', function()
{
    return 'all posts';
});
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Running <code>phpunit</code> again will return us to green.</p>

<h2>Laravel's Helper Assertions</h2>

<p>A test that you'll find yourself writing repeatedly is one that ensures that a controller passes a particular variable to a view. For example, the <code>index</code> method of <code>PostsController</code> should pass a <code>$posts</code> variable to its associated view, right? That way, the view can filter through all posts, and display them on the page. This is an important test to write!</p>

<p>If it's that common a task, then, once again, wouldn't it make sense for Laravel to provide a helper assertion to accomplish this very thing? Of course it would. And of course Laravel does!</p>

<p><code>Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase</code> includes a number of methods that will drastically reduce the amount of code needed to perform basic assertions. This list includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>assertViewHas</code></li>
<li><code>assertResponseOk</code></li>
<li><code>assertRedirectedTo</code></li>
<li><code>assertRedirectedToRoute</code></li>
<li><code>assertRedirectedToAction</code></li>
<li><code>assertSessionHas</code></li>
</ul>


<p>The following examples calls <code>GET /posts</code> and verifies that its views receives the variable, <code>$posts</code>.</p>

<p>```js app/tests/PostsControllerTest.php
public function testIndex()
{</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;call('GET', 'posts');

$this-&gt;assertViewHas('posts');
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Tip:</strong> When it comes to formatting, I prefer to provide a line break between a test's assertion and the code that prepares the stage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let's assume that the <code>posts</code> route consists of:</p>

<p>```js app/routes.php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>Route::get('posts', function()
{</p>

<pre><code>return View::make('posts.index');
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>Should we run <code>phpunit</code>, it will squawk with a helpful <em>next step</em> message:</p>

<p><code>bash
1) PostsControllerTest::testIndex
Failed asserting that an array has the key 'posts'.
</code></p>

<p>To make it green, we simply fetch the posts and pass it to the view.</p>

<p>```js app/routes.php
Route::get('posts', function()
{</p>

<pre><code>$posts = Post::all();

return View::make('posts.index')
    -&gt;with('posts', $posts);
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that, as the code currently stands, it only ensures that the variable, <code>$posts</code>, is passed to the view. It doesn't inspect its value. The <code>assertViewHas</code> optionally accepts a second argument to verify the value of the variable, as well as its existence.</p>

<p>```js app/tests/PostsControllerTest.php
public function testIndex()
{</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;call('GET', 'posts');

$this-&gt;assertViewHas('posts', 'foo');
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>With this modified code, unles the view has a variable, <code>$posts</code>, that is equal to <code>foo</code>, the test will fail. In this situation, though, it's likely that we'd rather not specify a value, but instead declare that the value be an instance of Laravel's <code>Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection</code> class. How might we accomplish that? PHPUnit provides a helpful <code>assertInstanceOf</code> assertion to fill this very need!</p>

<p>```js app/tests/PostsControllerTest.php
public function testIndex()
{</p>

<pre><code>$response = $this-&gt;call('GET', 'posts');

$this-&gt;assertViewHas('posts');

// getData() returns all vars attached to the response.
$posts = $response-&gt;original-&gt;getData()['posts'];

$this-&gt;assertInstanceOf('Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection', $posts);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>With this modification, we've declared that the controller <strong>must</strong> pass <code>$posts</code> - an instance of <code>Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection</code> - to the view. Excellent.</p>

<h2>Mocking the Database</h2>

<p>There's one glaring problem with our tests so far. Did you catch it?</p>

<blockquote><p>For each test, a SQL query is being performed on the database. Though this is useful for certain kinds of testing (acceptance, integration), for basic controller testing, it will only decrease the performance of your tests.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've drilled this into your skull multiple times at this point. We're not interested in testing Eloquent's ability to fetch records from a database. It has its own tests. Taylor knows it works! Let's not waste time and processing power repeating those same tests.</p>

<p>Instead, it's best to mock the database, and merely verify that the appropriate methods are called with the correct arguments. Or, in other words, we want to ensure that <code>Post::all()</code> never fires and hits the database. We know that works, so it doesn't require testing.</p>

<p>This section will depend heavily on the Mockery library. Please review that chapter if you haven't yet done so before moving on.</p>

<h3>RequiredÂ Refactoring</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, so far, we've structured the code in a way that makes it virtually impossible to test.</p>

<p>```js app/routes.php
Route::get('posts', function()
{</p>

<pre><code>// Ouch. We can't test this!!
$posts = Post::all();

return View::make('posts.index')
    -&gt;with('posts', $posts);
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>This is precisely why it's considered bad practice to nest Eloquent calls into your controllers. Don't confuse Laravel's facades, which are testable and can be swapped out with mocks, with your Eloquent models. The solution is to inject the database layer into the controller through the constructor. This requires some refactoring.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Warning:</strong> Storing logic in route callbacks is useful for small projects and APIs, but they make testing incredibly difficult. For applications of any considerable size, use controllers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let's replace the <code>posts</code> route with:</p>

<p><code>js app/routes.php
Route::resource('posts', 'PostsController');
</code></p>

<p>...and create the necessary resourceful controller with Artisan.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ php artisan controller:make PostsController
Controller created successfully!
</code></p>

<p>Now, rather than referencing the <code>Post</code> model directly, we'll inject it into the controller's constructor. Here's a condensed example that omits all restful methods except the one that we're currently interested in testing.</p>

<p>```js app/controllers/PostsController.php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>class PostsController extends BaseController {</p>

<p>  protected $post;</p>

<p>  public function __construct(Post $post)
  {</p>

<pre><code>  $this-&gt;post = $post;
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public function index()
  {</p>

<pre><code>  $posts = $this-&gt;post-&gt;all();

  return View::make('posts.index')
    -&gt;with('posts', $posts);
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This is a significantly better way to structure the code. Because the model is now injected, we have the ability to swap it out with a mocked version for testing. Here's an example of doing just that:</p>

<p>```js app/tests/PostsControllerTest.php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>class PostsControllerTest extends TestCase {</p>

<pre><code>public function __construct()
{
    // We have no interest in testing Eloquent
    $this-&gt;mock = Mockery::mock('Eloquent', 'Post');
}

public function tearDown()
{
    Mockery::close();
}

public function testIndex()
{
    $this-&gt;mock
         -&gt;shouldReceive('all')
         -&gt;once()
         -&gt;andReturn('foo');

    $this-&gt;app-&gt;instance('Post', $this-&gt;mock);

    $this-&gt;call('GET', 'posts');

    $this-&gt;assertViewHas('posts');
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The key benfit to this restructuring is that, now, the database will never needlessly be hit. Instead, using Mockery, we merely verify that the <code>all</code> method is triggered on the model.</p>

<p>```js
$this->mock</p>

<pre><code> -&gt;shouldReceive('all')
 -&gt;once()
 -&gt;andReturn('foo');
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3>The IoC Container</h3>

<p>Laravel's IoC container drastically eases the process of injecting dependencies into your classes. Each time a controller is requested, it is resolved out of the IoC container. As such, when we need to declare that a mock version of <code>Post</code> should be used for testing, we only need to provide Laravel with the instance of <code>Post</code> that should be used.</p>

<p><code>js
$this-&gt;app-&gt;instance('Post', $this-&gt;mock);
</code></p>
